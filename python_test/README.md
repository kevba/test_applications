# Python test application
This is the Python application used in an experiment as a part of graduation. The application itself is a simple HTTP server.

*setup*
The application has no external dependencies, so nothing needs to be installed.
To run the application simply type: `make run`. If you want to run the application on a different port run it as `python run.py {port number}`
